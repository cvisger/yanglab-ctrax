This project provides [Ctrax](http://ctrax.sourceforge.net/) extensions for tracking in difficult lighting conditions with strong shadows or recurring "on"/"off" changes in lighting.  A detailed description of the extensions and what videos we used them for can be found in an accompanying [paper](http://www.nature.com/srep/2015/150701/srep10432/full/srep10432.html).
